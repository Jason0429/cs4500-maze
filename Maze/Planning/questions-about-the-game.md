Concerning the development of the Labryinth Game Server Project, we wanted to clarify certain aspects of the game itself. Specifically, we had these questions:

* Is the referee a component of the game server or a type of client in and of itself?
* What role does the referree play in the game other than monitoring illegitimate actions and starting the game?
* What system/protocol does the logical sign-up use and how does it relate to communication-sign-ups?

We believe that these questions are essential details that will help us make architectual decisions for a flexible and maintainable system. We would appreciate it very much if these questions could be answered sooner than later. Thank you.
