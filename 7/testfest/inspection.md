## TEST FEST

No deductions; `xbad` does not directly use the input spec to form the cheaters output.

## GIT LOG INSPECTION

[60/70]

- [0/10] for git add remote as instructed by the "new repo" instructions of GH Enterprise
    - Did not follow `git add remote` instructions. Repo does not contain old history from before Nov. 3.
- [30/30] checking that a large non-trivial commit is not copied code from other repo.
- [30/30] same as above with a different commit.

## TECH DEBT DOWNPAYMENT -- everyone

[60/80]

- [0/20] for an accurate and helpful self evaluation.
  - Linked to post-deadline commit d99509dfc35f13ec88f389bcd36cdfad93d4572f, which yields 0 accuracy points
- [10/10] descriptive tasks in todo.md (e.g. not "Improve the code").
- [50/50] the git commit message for five completed bullets help the reader understand the change and appreciate the improvement to the code.
 

## REQUIRED REVISION

[32/40]

The require revision calls for
- the relaxation of the constraints on the board size
- a suitability check for the board size vs player number

- [10/20]: for 1 unit test for a non 7x7 square board (10 pts), and 1 unit test for a non-square board (10 pts)
- [6/10] a unit test that validates that a board is suitable for the given number of players
- [6/10] a unit that that rejects a board as too small for the given number of players
- For last two tests, do not have this but acknowledged on self-eval so giving 60%
